# Mobile Developer Coding Challenge (Junior)

This repo is created for Audiobooks coding challenge.

## The Aim

I built the two-screen podcast app provided the details below : 

1-) Show a list of podcasts using the endpoint provided below.
2-) Each list item should show the podcast thumbnail, title, and publisher name. There is NO need to show the Favourite text shown in the mock for screen 1.
